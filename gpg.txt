All products built in 2020
==========================

All of our build products (tarballs, zip files, MSI installers,
DMG disk images and stand-alone binaries) are GPG signed, and have
a detached GPG signature to go along with them.

The detached signatures are named <original-file-name>.sig, and
are ASCII-armoured.

Our downloads are available at the address https://dl.mumble.info.
For example, a released product called "product-1.0.tar.gz" would
be available at

    https://dl.mumble.info/product-1.0.tar.gz

and its detached signature would be available at

    https://dl.mumble.info/products-1.0.tar.gz.sig

The signing of our build products is entirely automatic, and happens
inside the Mumble build infrastructure.
